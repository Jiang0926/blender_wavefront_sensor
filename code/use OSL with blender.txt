- Set python to automatically UNbuffer output:
-- put PYTHONUNBUFFERED=on on your .bash_profile

- force OSL to UNoptimize shadders
-- OSL_OPTIONS="optimize=0" on .bash_profile

- gerp now is the responsable for buffering
-- use grep --line-buffered 

- instead of redirecting to a file like > output.txt, use another pipe to a python script that handles the upcoming text
-- blender | grep --line-buffered "something" | pipeServer.py 

- algorithm

1 - in blender, setup a timer
2 - each iterations:
2.1 - echo a "command" to the console to prepare a new file
2.2 - do a render so the "detector" generates the hit data in the file
2.3 - read the file and compute stuff
